// To reduce code bloat, I decided to go with using the low-level
// [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package instead of something like
// [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio). I know this made the code worse as we
// had to do things such as normalizing pagination options, but it should help
// vastly increase the benchmarks when we have three different server node
// consumers and a payment manager running at the same time as the http package
// utilizes functions for requests instead of complicated and heavy classes.
